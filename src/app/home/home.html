                    Tomorrow is the most important thing in life. Comes into us at midnight very clean. 
                    It's perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands. 
                    It hopes we've learned something from yesterday.

                    Everybody that I was in school with had an uncle or father in the law, 
                    and I started to realize that I was going to end up writing briefs for 
                    about ten years for these fellows who I thought I was smarter than. 
                    And I was kind of losing my feeling for that.
