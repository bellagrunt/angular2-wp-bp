    <div class="news-post">
        <p>Everyday I will be updating this new post. I will add at least one
            or two different componends to the page as I go to mark my progress
            of the project. My goal is to build an angular2 app with fully integrated 
            automation to the page.

            Yesterday Feb 15th started to work on the contact page.
            Creating a "contact us" form.
            Today I figured out the login functionality in angular2.
            I created a new "login" page and then routed it in the navigation.

            Over the weekend I made a new build that now contains webpack instead
            of system.js.

    <h2>Fourth post: Feb 27 2017</h2>
    <div class="news-post">
        <p>
            Refactored some code over the last few days. Changed some stuff in the ts file. 
            I also created a gallery in gallery page, now looking to do some custom javascript around
            it. Perhaps some more advanced angular2 parts to it. This will make it more diverse and move
            into more advanced angular2. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Fifth post: Feb 28 2017</h2>
    <div class="news-post">
        <p>
            Created some changes in home, about, news, and login.
            I then updated some references I will be adding in some later documentation.
            Also I re-styled the navigation bar to be responsive and refactored the css from the main style.css
            to the nav.css. I'm currently making a login function where you can sign in using google by using
            firebase.

    <h2>Sixth post: March 02 2017</h2>
    <div class="news-post">
        <p>
            Making styling changes around the whole theme. Researching on the gallery component at the moment.
            Also opened up the login page so you can click on the google button to sign in. Going to also work with 
            more css and html changes in home, about, and the news. Perhaps if I get the time, to make a search option
            in the navigation bar.

            Demo out my project to a few people to get some feed back and started to build out the testing framework. 
            Going to teach some people on angular2 and protractor with my template. Currently working
            teaching myself java again for android development and to do unit testing with android. 
            So far its not too bad but with a slight learning curve and getting familiar with the structure of the 
            project.
