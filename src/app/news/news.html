        <p>Everyday I will be updating this new post. I will add at least one
            or two different componends to the page as I go to mark my progress
            of the project. My goal is to build an angular2 app with fully integrated 
            automation to the page.

            Yesterday Feb 15th started to work on the contact page.
            Creating a "contact us" form.
            Today I figured out the login functionality in angular2.
            I created a new "login" page and then routed it in the navigation.

            Over the weekend I made a new build that now contains webpack instead
            of system.js.

            Refactored some code over the last few days. Changed some stuff in the ts file. 
            I also created a gallery in gallery page, now looking to do some custom javascript around
            it. Perhaps some more advanced angular2 parts to it. This will make it more diverse and move
            into more advanced angular2.
